    <title>Reflection Assignment</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>This class has been one of the hardest classes I hav ever taken. It was challenging mentally and physically taxing on the body. I am happy to have this time to really know what a developer experiences. The differences I noticed was HTML & CSS were more so straight forward in the design layout. Javascript or scripting on the other hand you have to map out the design or your code will fail. Restructuring my brain to complete these assignments took a <b>LONG</b> time but through the help of family, friends and the school I was able to survive.<br><br> I was not ready for the workload! I was very overwhelming and had anxiety early on with my assignments. Took me a long time to get confortable with the material. The biggest takeaway is do not be scared to ask for help. I was very prideful and it cost me alot of time, stress, and heavily affected my grades. </p>
